# Two-stage vs One-stage Detectors

### Two-stage Detectors
-_Models in the R-CNN family are all region-based._ - [[R-CNN]]()
* (1) First, the model proposes a set of regions of interests by select search or regional proposal network. The proposed regions are sparse as the potential bounding box candidates can be infinite. 
* (2) Then a classifier only processes the region candidates.

The other different approach skips the region proposal stage and runs detection directly over a dense sampling of possible locations. This is how a one-stage object detection algorithm works. This is faster and simpler, but might potentially drag down the performance a bit.

### One-stage Detectors
-YOLO (You only look once): YOLOv1, YOLOv2, YOLOv3, Tiny YOLO - [[YOLO]](https://github.com/yehengchen/ObjectDetection/blob/master/OneStage/yolo/yolo.md)
