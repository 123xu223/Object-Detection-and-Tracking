# SDD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector
*The Single Shot Detector (SSD; Liu et al, 2016) is one of the first attempts at using convolutional neural networkâ€™s pyramidal feature hierarchy for efficient detection of objects of various sizes.*

## Image Pyramid
SSD uses the VGG-16 model pre-trained on ImageNet as its base model for extracting useful image features. On top of VGG16, SSD adds several conv feature layers of decreasing sizes. They can be seen as a pyramid representation of images at different scales. Intuitively large fine-grained feature maps at earlier levels are good at capturing small objects and small coarse-grained feature maps can detect large objects well. In SSD, the detection happens in every pyramidal layer, targeting at objects of various sizes.
